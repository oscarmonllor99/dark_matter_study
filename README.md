# dark_matter_study
An study of the effects of dark matter on galactic dynamics with Python: rotational curves, velocity distribution functions, galactic morphologies, two-point correlation function, etc. The alternative to the dark matter hypothesis, MOND, is also considered and implemented. 

pp, pp_mond, pm --> Codes that solve the N-Body problem. "pp" is the "particle-particle" or "direct summation" method. On the other hand "pm" is the "particle-mesh" method.

The other codes analyze the outputs from pp, pp_mond or pm, and their names describe their functionality.

The dependencies are: Numba, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scipy and Scikit-learn.
